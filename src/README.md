# This folder contains code for:

1. GUI
2. Speech to Text
3. Tree View (Table GUI)
4. Emotion Recognition
5. Neural Network for logic gate AND.

## Instructions

* ```guif.py``` (GUI). Also contains the code for query and metadata processing.

* ```speechrec.py``` uses google's speech to text api for converting spoken words to text.

* ```table2.py``` provides an interface for selecting a frame which when clicked upon runs the video player.

* ```videoplayer2.py``` uses google's speech to text api for converting spoken words to text.

* ```video_emotion_color_demo_rahul.py``` : code which combines Oriagga's emotion, TensorFlow's Face Recognition and TensorFlow's Object recognition models. Also, creates the metadata.

* ```keras_and_nn.py``` contains the neural networking for and operation.

### Run GUI:
> python guif-6.py


* The metadata for a particular video on the HDD can be created using the *'select a file'* button on the GUI.
